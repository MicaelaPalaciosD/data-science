## Read Me for Week 6. Controls pt 2
Learning R:
- Handling NA in R
- computational time can really be annoying because it limits or burdens experimentation.

R and Content: 
-doing an orthogonal ml for LTE. in sample throwing we throw data no we use all the data.
- HTE --> example with OHIE (healthcare insurance)
- free means not penalized (in R)
- Increased price (adding directly to it ) to see the effect on elasticity. I learned how to check for the elasticity change. in my case it was less elastic with price increase, could be because I increased price a lot.
- Increased price (adding directly to it ) to see the effect on elasticity. I learned how to check for the elasticity change. 
- in my case it was less elastic with price increase, could be because I increased price a lot (by 65).
- increasing price by less (0.5) increased elasticity which was expected
- decreasing the price a bit (0.5) decreased elasticity. This parts I added as branches and also added screenshots.
 - we can see that in the baseline.
