## Read Me for Week 6. Controls pt 1
Learning R:
- learned how to write with italic
- learned to pull left and right in slide to make notes or make things visible.


R and Content: 
-  I am leaving some clarifications on the slides. This make it easier for me to understand the topic
- R2 indicates how much independent signal you have for estimating 


Going through the content slowly to solve some mind fogs: 
- Partial effect in the regression because we fixed one brand, we are not looking at general effect.
- More controls than data points is not good
- baseline regression assumes linear increase, we can adapt it to quadratic term
- we dont want SE of b hat but of y hat. In applied econometrics we care about good parameter (b) but here we care about good predictions (y)
