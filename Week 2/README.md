## Read Me for Week 2
- Downloaded the Rmarkdown file with prof Kapoorâ€™s code and installed  R tools to be able to work with his code. Also installed the libraries he used.
- The comments made by Kapoor are with ''', my comments in the code are made using #
- I familiarized myself with Git and GitHub which is why I added random files to this folder to see how branches, commiting and pulling would look like. That is also why I created a file with .py to see how it worked with many different programming languages
- I also practiced with the Hello_World available from GitHub and some youtube videos to understand the branches and features
