## Read Me for Week 2
- Downloaded the Rmarkdown file with prof Kapoorâ€™s code and installed  R tools to be able to work with his code. Also installed the libraries he used.
- The comments made by Kapoor are with ''', my comments in the code are made using #
- I used the github desktop using R-studio to propose this change. Saw that it is easier to create folders from R studio.
- I changed computers mid block so I had to install everything again and practiced with installing libraries, git desktop (I mention this because the first time it took me a lot of time to do it but now I feel more comfortable with the softwares)
- Uploaded the file and solved issues from not being sure which path I was using. Learned to use getwd() and setwd()
