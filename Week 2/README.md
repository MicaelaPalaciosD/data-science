## Read Me for Week 2
- Downloaded the Rmarkdown file with prof Kapoorâ€™s code and installed  R tools to be able to work with his code. Also installed the libraries he used.
- The comments made by Kapoor are with ''', my comments in the code are made using #
- I used the github desktop using R-studio to propose this change. Saw that it is easier to create folders from R studio.
- I changed computers mid block so I had to install everything again and practiced which was a bit hard regarding paths. 
- Learned to use getwd() and setwd(). Uploaded the file and solved issues from not being sure which path I was using. 
- Bootsrap: B was how many times I sample from data set so higher means more samples and also computational time. trade off. 
- sd increses as B decreases because of that trade off
- learned how to make histogram with stored values (here it was mean)
- values are not the same as in the slides because of how bootstrap works
- learned how to use the BH algorithm using R, the steps can be coded
- BH algorithm plot. making q smaller makes the slope flatter which shows more strict restrictions. I changed it to see how the graph changes
- Also increasing the nr of hypothesis could have this effect. With too many hypothesis, Algorithm doesnt seem useful.
