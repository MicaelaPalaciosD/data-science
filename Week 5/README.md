## Read Me for Week 5. Classification
Learning R:
- Important to run before chunks for everything to work
- had a problem with the source, now I know that I know how to put sources cause I identified the problem when ChatGPT was suggesting something else.
- change colors in graphs :)
- Downloaded sources from taddy (they were not in the data folder provided to us)
- learned how to use gamlr
- learned to greaph the roc curve

R and Content: 
- again with randomization I do not have the same as the slides.
- Classification rule: you can decide the decision boundary.
- higher --> fewer predictions as positive, less FPR more FNR
- means TPR decreases and TNR increases



Going through the content slowly to solve some mind fogs: 
- Lasso doesnt have that randomization in my data and plots i see same as slides
