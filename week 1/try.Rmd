## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document of the original code shown in the lecture. I tried to do it with the help of chatGPT to later practice changing things on this code and see how it affects the output. UPDATE: I could not practice directly so I just put what each function did using the help of chatgpt.

First, loading the data and viewing it.
```{r dataset}
CEO_Diary <- read.csv ("D:/Documentos/Documents/Master/Data Science/data/survey_response_data.csv")
View(CEO_Diary)
```

CEO_Diary is called a dataframe. To subset the data you can use
```{r subset_data}
CEO_Diary[1:15,c(1:5,37, 39, 40)]
```

To fin out the "class" of a variable you use apply.
CHECK WHAT DOES THE 2 do. (2 means it is applied to columns, 1 would have meant rows)
```{r}
apply(CEO_Diary,2,class)
```

other functions include returning the number of rows available:
```{r}
nrow(CEO_Diary)
```

or summary statistics:
in this case we are giving summary statistics of the columns 1-5
```{r}
summary(CEO_Diary[1:5])

```

or open a graphic (in this case it is a png file from a file path, you can decide the size)
```{r}
 png(file="figs/CEOTypes.png", width=800, height=300)
```

par(mar=c(9, 3, 1, 1)):

par() is used to set graphical parameters.
mar=c(9, 3, 1, 1) adjusts the margins of the plot. The mar argument specifies the size of the margins in the order: bottom, left, top, and right. Here, the bottom margin is set to 9 (to accommodate rotated labels), and the other margins are smaller.
```{r}
par(mar=c(9, 3 ,1,1))
  
```
table(CEO_Diary$type): Creates a frequency table of the type variable in the CEO_Diary data frame.
prop.table(): Converts the frequency table into proportions (so the bar heights represent proportions rather than raw counts).
barplot(): Plots a bar chart of the proportions.
las=2: Rotates the axis labels to be perpendicular to the axis, making them easier to read when there are many or long labels.
```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type)), las=2)

```

This closes the graphics device, saving the image file to the specified path.
```{r}
# dev.off()
```


Now what would have happened without the specifications:

```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type)));

table(CEO_Diary$type);

prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type));
```


You can also fit statistical models, fit regression of Strategy (=1 if meeting about strategy) on

```{r}
fit <- glm(strategy ~ consultants + politicians, data=CEO_Diary); summary(fit)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
