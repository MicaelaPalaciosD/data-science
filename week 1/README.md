## Read Me for Week 1
- Made an Rmarkdown file with prof Kapoorâ€™s code and expleained each part of the code that was given to us with the help of chatGPT
- I was unable to use the data available on Canvas because it did not contain the same data as in the slides (survey_response_data)
- I familiarized myself with Git and GitHub which is why I added random files to this folder to see how branches, commiting and pulling would look like
- I also practiced with the Hello_World available from GitHub and some youtube videos to understand the branches and features
